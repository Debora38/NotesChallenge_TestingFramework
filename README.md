# Notes Challenge: Building a Testing Framework

As we were challenged to test a program without using any existing testing framework, I came up with the <a href="https://github.com/Debora38/NotesChallenge_TestingFramework/blob/master/test/testing_framework.js">enclosed file</a> that creates a matcher, used to test a <a href="https://github.com/Debora38/NotesChallenge_TestingFramework/blob/master/lib/spec/note_test.js">spec example</a>.<br>

Being then given strict instructions on how to continue the project, I created a **new repo for the <a href="https://github.com/Debora38/NoteProject-js">Notes Challenge</a>**.
